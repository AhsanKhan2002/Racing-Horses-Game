🐎 Horse Racing Game

A C# Windows Forms application that simulates a horse race with randomized speeds, live race updates, and result tracking.

📌 Overview

This project is a Windows Forms–based game where players can start a horse race simulation and watch as each horse competes to reach the finish line. The application demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP), event-driven programming, and the use of Windows Forms GUI components in C#.

🚀 Features

Interactive Gameplay: Start and restart buttons control the race simulation.

Horse Simulation: Each horse is represented with a number and image. Horses move clockwise with randomized speeds for every race.

Collision-Free Movement: Horses run independently without overlapping each other.

Dynamic Updates: A textbox constantly updates with the current leader, adding commentary to the race.

Race Completion: The race ends when all horses cross the finish line, and results are displayed.

Results Tracking:

Displays the winner in three textboxes

Shows a tally table with race results

Tracks horse speed, timing, and standings

🛠️ Technical Concepts & Skills Utilized

C# & Windows Forms: Designed an event-driven application using GUI components such as buttons, textboxes, and tables.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Structured code with classes and objects to represent horses and race logic.

Randomization: Implemented randomized horse speeds to create unique race outcomes.

Timers & Events: Leveraged Windows Forms timers to control movement updates and ensure smooth animation.

Data Handling: Used arrays/lists to track horse statistics (speed, timing, wins).

User Interface Design: Created an interactive and responsive UI with live updates during the race.

Code Reusability & Modularity: Encapsulated logic for scalability and cleaner maintenance.

📂 How to Run

Download or clone the project repository.

Open the project in Visual Studio.

Build and run the project (Execute).

The Windows Form UI will launch, allowing you to start the race simulation.

🎮 Demo Gameplay Flow

Click Start to begin the race.

Horses move across the track with random speeds.

A live textbox updates the leading horse with captions.

When the last horse finishes, the race stops.

Results table displays winner details, timing, and stats.

Use Restart to play again with new randomized results.
